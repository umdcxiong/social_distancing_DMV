# social_distancing_DMV

This study examines the impact of factors related to social distancing, human mobility, enforcement strategies, hospital capacity, and testing capacity on COVID-19 outcomes within counties located in District of Columbia as well as the states of Maryland and Virginia. The manuscript is currently under review with the PLOS ONE journal.
In this repository, we provide the data and the STATA codes that were used in estimation of the models presented in the study. 

To use the data and codes:
•	Open the data file (Data. csv) in STATA;
•	Run the codes under the “STATA code for setting the date variable” line to generate and set the date variable for the data file;
•	Run the STATA code under the “STATA code for specifying the panelvar and timevar” line to designate these variables as the panel and time variables in the data file;
•	Run the STATA codes for the COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths to estimate the corresponding generalized least squares (GLS) panel data models.
